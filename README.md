# GreedyGameAssignment (MVVM + Room + Api + RecyclerView ) üì±

# Problem statement
-  Get the latest breaking news articles and show them in a list
-  Each article should have an image, title, date and a short description
-  On clicking on an article, it should show the full article
- All items in the list should have a ‚Äúsave to read later‚Äù button which saves the articles
  for reading later in a persistent format until the app is closed.
- The breaking news list should have a search by title feature
- Save to read later should have a list of all news saved and clicking on them shows
the full article.
